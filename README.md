# ML-Algorithms
Implementation of some important machine learning algorithms as described in one of the famous research paper "Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore" by Stanford University, CA on miscellaneous data-sets.

/test/ - Supervised learning algorithms:

1. Regression Analysis using Matrix Method
2. Multivariable Regression analysis using Widrow-Hoff Method
3. Logistic Regression
4. Gaussian discriminant analysis
5. Naive-Bayes Classification
6. Support Vector Machine using scikit-learn

/test2/ - Unsupervised learning algorithms:

1. K-Means Algorithm
2. EM Algorithm using scikit-learn

# To Do:
Implement more machine learning algorithms.
